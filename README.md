# Spec-talks gem â€” now your specs on your mac can talk with you :)

### This is beta now

## It was checked only on MacOS X. I don't know what present on linux or windows

This gem using base gem [talks](https://github.com/ruby-talks/talks). You can use it if you want to hear when your specs (with rspec)
start and when they end. Maybe I'll add here something more later :)

## Why?

This idea appears on reddotrubyconf just as is :) I just thought about slow specs in rails and decided that I want to hear when they end.
This gem not really for rails, for rails I will do another gem with another hacks. This gem for your reeeeeeally slow specs.

## How?

This gem using gem `talks` and overwrites some of rspec methods when you call `spec-talks` instead of `rspec` from your command line.

### Using spec-talks

```bash
$ gem install spec-talks
$ spec-talks folder_with_rspec_specs # instead of just `rspec folder_with_rspec_specs`
```

Of course you can use it with bundler:

`Gemfile`
```ruby
group :test do
  gem 'rspec'
  gem 'spec-talks'
end
```

`bash`
```bash
$ bundle install
$ bundle exec spec-talks folder_with_your_specs
```

And of course it's not overwrites rspec methods when you use original `rspec` command line tool.

## Who?
